28m_047,500.67,519.19,and and um but um um and i i guess also too uh mean i one thing i i've been that helps me to think about positive experiences that that i that that that that i um that that that that that that i had that i w wouldn't have had if i didn't stutter,and i guess also too mean one thing that helps me to think about positive experiences that i had that i wouldn't have had if i didn't stutter
28m_048,519.37,526.89,so for example like coming to a conference like this is is is kinda the the the the the pinnacle of that and you know if i didn't stutter i wouldn't get to experience something like this,so for example like coming to a conference like this is kinda the pinnacle of that and you know if i didn't stutter i wouldn't get to experience something like this
28m_049,541.17,553.61,i think i mean the way that i would want uh any l listener to to um um interpret stuttering is just that you know it's just a form of diversity and that that you know not everybody communicates the same way,i think i mean the way that i would want any listener to interpret stuttering is just that you know it's just a form of diversity and that you know not everybody communicates the same way

29ma_008,86.43,95.0,and every every word i said would i would say when at its peak almost every word i said had a little bit of stuttering in it um,i would say when at its peak almost every word i said had a little bit of stuttering in it
29ma_009,96.57,105.24,and now i still have it still fluctuates there's still good days and bad days,it still fluctuates there's still good days and bad days
29ma_010,105.77,114.58,and days where i'm still trying not to stutter and still avoiding and on those days i would say i still think about stuttering quite often,and days where i'm still trying not to stutter and still avoiding and on those days i would say i still think about stuttering quite often

29ma_020,183.25,184.25,uh yeah,yeah
29ma_021,191.67,198.59,um i think lots of i guess the cause the actual physical mechanism that creates a disfluency,i guess the cause the actual physical mechanism that creates a disfluency
29ma_022,198.59,205.93,it seems that most of the research is suggesting it's has uh genetic origins,it seems that most of the research is suggesting it's has genetic origins

508_051,321.7,330.82,basically anything um to get me talking in in every single way just to see if there is a pattern that she can detect on like a certain activity,basically anything to get me talking in every single way just to see if there is a pattern that she can detect on like a certain activity
508_052,331.76,336.66,and i was basically fluent in in all of that so,and i was basically fluent in all of that so
508_053,337.83,342.03,and then when it my stuttering came back at thirteen i also went to a speech therapist again,and then my stuttering came back at thirteen i also went to a speech therapist again
508_054,342.95,351.93,um that one i do remember because i went into this uh speech therapist's office and she was asking me,that one i do remember because i went into this speech therapist's office and she was asking me

508_056,356.2,359.28,and so she again had me go through a series of things,and so she again had me go through a series of things
508_057,359.9,365.99,um went through it in a very organic way because i kinda forgot that i was seeing a speech therapist which was good um,went through it in a very organic way because i kinda forgot that i was seeing a speech therapist which was good
508_058,366.85,371.86,but again she had she did not detect anything um in any activity,but again she did not detect anything in any activity
508_059,372.59,380.55,although the only thing that she said was when i was reading she told me that at times i was reading too fast,although the only thing that she said was when i was reading she told me that at times i was reading too fast
508_060,382.0,392.01,and it wasn't she didn't feel like it was because of stuttering but just um for some reason i was just having a faster speed on reading,and she didn't feel like it was because of stuttering but just for some reason i was just having a faster speed on reading
508_061,392.68,396.14,and so she had told me to slow down,and so she had told me to slow down
508_062,396.36,398.06,and i don't know if that was for speech or for what,and i don't know if that was for speech or for what
508_063,398.11,400.77,but that was the only feedback that i got from her,but that was the only feedback that i got from her
508_064,401.62,410.59,um and so i think that like while it wasn't directed towards my stuttering per se,and so i think that like while it wasn't directed towards my stuttering per se
508_065,410.59,415.17,i feel like it did help me read more effectively like out loud,i feel like it did help me read more effectively like out loud
508_066,415.86,421.93,just because i knew that i could trust in in talking slower and and feeling comfortable with that,just because i knew that i could trust in talking slower and feeling comfortable with that
508_067,422.84,430.62,uh 'cause oftentimes i've i would feel like uh like if i wasn't doing something fast enough it would be like go faster go faster go faster,'cause oftentimes i would feel like if i wasn't doing something fast enough it would be like go faster
508_068,431.24,436.59,um like maybe that was a a product of either the class i was in or the environment i was raised in,like maybe that was a product of either the class i was in or the environment i was raised in
508_069,436.7,443.84,and so actually being able to told to like slow down but maybe slow down to a normal pace was was extremely helpful,and so actually being told to like slow down but maybe slow down to a normal pace was extremely helpful
508_070,457.94,461.76,uh f you said effective communication right,you said effective communication right
508_071,462.33,464.45,successful communication,successful communication

508_076,499.45,511.23,um you know it it's definitely different speaking i think sometimes like ninety percent of the time i'm speaking f to another person who speaks english as their first language,you know it's definitely different speaking i think sometimes like ninety percent of the time i'm speaking to another person who speaks english as their first language
508_077,511.24,517.58,and so uh i've noticed that sometimes i can i can even communicate more effectively now with my parents,and so i've noticed that sometimes i can even communicate more effectively now with my parents
508_078,518.19,522.01,because of the level or like the type of words that i know that they'll understand,because of the like the type of words that i know that they'll understand

508_080,531.09,539.96,and so um so yeah i think u uh successful communication can look very very differently between who you're talking with and and what their background is,and so yeah i think u successful communication can look very very differently between who you're talking with and what their background is
508_081,548.21,556.77,i would've got better grades i'll tell you that um because uh uh i was basically a straight a student until second grade,i would've got better grades i'll tell you that because i was basically a straight a student until second grade
508_082,556.79,560.12,and then uh my participation grade started to drop,and then my participation grade started to drop
508_083,560.68,563.25,um just because i was more shy in the classroom,just because i was more shy in the classroom
508_084,563.99,571.43,um definitely had a lot of avoidance when it came to um you know raising my hand or or participating,definitely had a lot of avoidance when it came to you know raising my hand or participating
508_085,571.44,583.24,and and when you look at you know the teacher's curriculum at the time it's like well uh you know a percentage of your of your class is on tests or homework or then there's class participation,and when you look at you know the teacher's curriculum at the time it's like well you know a percentage of your class is on tests or homework or then there's class participation
508_086,583.24,590.71,and so you know in my mind i was like hey uh like an a or well a b is like eighty percent right,and so you know in my mind i was like hey like well a b is like eighty percent right
508_087,590.71,595.48,so if i get if i try to get over ninety percent on everything else but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad,so if i try to get over ninety percent on everything else but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad
508_088,595.72,605.26,but then um but then that also maybe without stuttering it would've also changed the pressure that um was put on uh by both myself and my parents,but then but then that also maybe without stuttering it would've also changed the pressure that was put on by both myself and my parents
508_089,605.26,608.74,because then they're like hey why are why are you lacking in this,because then they're like hey why are you lacking in this
